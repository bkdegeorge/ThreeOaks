									<p>Organized in 2024, Three Oaks is a Midwest Professional Golf Tour based on distinguished venues, high-level purses, and first-class player experiences. Located in Southeast Wisconsin, the tour will begin hosting events in September of 2025. Three Oaks was founded on the idea of empowering individuals through golf, which can mean a number of things, but to us it means opportunity. We see golf as the building block of opportunity, which starts with our players. Three Oaks is here to provide a better opportunity to our players, whether that be through competition, financial upside, or communal involvement.</p>
									<p>Competition will be formatted in a 54 hole stroke play style, with a cut preceding the third round. As former players, we realize that competition is the truest test in golf and as a Tour we cherish that. We take incredible pride in our venues, conditions, and course set up. Three Oaks will aim to test all facets of each player's game, through course conditions and set up. We want to not only provide high level competition, but also create the environment that will prepare each player for the PGA TOUR.</p>
									<p>Three Oaks believes players should be exposed to consistent financial upside to provide the opportunities needed to get to the next level. Given a full field, we expect purses to regularly exceed $400,000. However, instead of concentrating the majority of the purse inside the top 5, purses will be spread deeper through the field. We believe the pay structure will greatly reward quality, consistent play and provide players the opportunity to earn a legitimate living without having to finish in the top 5 every week.</p>
									<p>Our roots as a tour are deeply entrenched in the Midwest, an area of the country we hope to put on display. Three Oaks strongly believes the infrastructure of our communities is based on our investment in others and as a result, we aspire to empower local business and communities through acts of charitable involvement. Each event we run will be in collaboration with a local charity or non-profit, driven to make a difference in our local communities. We believe Wisconsin and the midwest has a lot to offer, not only top-tier golf, but also unique businesses, charities, and communities that deserve to be promoted.</p>
									<p>Three Oaks will strive to put players, businesses, and communities in a position to grow together. Each event will provide players the opportunity to give back if they so choose while also encouraging future relationships to grow. Through our charitable partners, non profit supporters, and our local businesses, we believe we can use golf to positively impact each community.</p>

								<div id="why-three-oaks" class="content-section">
									<p>Three Oaks, from inception, was founded on the idea of empowering individuals through golf. To us, this comes in the form of opportunity, which we believe is critical to taking the next step. Whether the next step is the PGA Tour or helping our communities in their mission, we want to help facilitate those opportunities.</p>
									<h3>Venues</h3>
									<p>At Three Oaks we want to run tournaments that challenge the players skills, both physically and mentally. We want you, as the player, to feel like your sharpened skills will give you a competitive edge that week. We believe in Championship quality setups and conditions, put on by superior venues. We pride ourselves on hosting our events at golf courses that will check all of the boxes, because as players, we know that you want to separate yourself from the field and what better way to do that than play a true championship golf course, in prime condition.</p>
									<h3>Purses</h3>
									<p>At Three Oaks it is our mission to change how Non-PGA sanctioned events are constructed. As the strength of the field continues to increase and the dream of playing on the PGA Tour becomes more challenging and expensive, rewarding good play becomes essential. Our purses will top over $400,000, given a full field. At Three Oaks, players are competing for situation changing money, every week they tee it up. Additionally, we believe that you should be rewarded for playing good golf, even if you don't finish inside the top 5, where most purses are concentrated. At Three Oaks our purses are distributed deeper, meaning a 20th place finish could as much as double or triple your entry fee.</p>
									<h3>Experience</h3>
									<p>What separates good events from great ones? It's usually the experience. For us, experience is everything, from the time you arrive on property until the last putt falls, we want our events to be memorable. Three Oaks is determined to provide the best possible experience we can, while providing you the player with a place to develop your game. Whether it's the uniqueness of our events, the newly formed relationships you'll make, or the elevated golf you'll be a part of, we want all of it to create a memorable experience that lasts.</p>
									<h3>Sponsors</h3>
									<p>At Three Oaks we believe opportunity can be found in all aspects of our events, none greater than the opportunity to get involved. With our local roots dug deep, we know the impact business has on Midwest culture and the opportunity it provides. We strongly believe we can use golf to create positive change in our communities. Through partnerships rich in the love of golf, we can work together to create better opportunities for our players, better opportunities for our communities, and better opportunities for those involved in our events to make a difference. Each Three Oaks event will have a local charity, non-profit, or "good cause" organization involved to try and spark this positive change. Supporting local efforts is foundational to our relationships with our sponsors, however, that doesn't just mean through charity. For us, supporting local efforts means an investment in our local businesses, with the goal of raising the community all together. At Three Oaks, we believe it takes a team to create something truly lasting. By bringing charities, businesses, and professional golfers together, we believe we can greatly impact our communities and have a positive impact for years to come.</p>

												<center><h3 class="staff-title">Managing Partner/Co-Founder</h3></center>
												<p>When talking about Austin, Wisconsin, and golf, it is hard to separate the three. Born and raised in Sussex, WI, Austin began playing golf in late middle school. He would go on to play Collegiate golf at the University of Marquette, located in Milwaukee. Austin turned professional in 2019 after graduating Marquette with a degree in Business Administration and Marketing. He played 5 years of professional golf on the mini tours and after not quite breaking through decided to turn his attention to Three Oaks. Austin started Three Oaks Golf to empower players and give them the opportunities in competition he felt was lacking during his playing career.</p>

												<center><h3 class="staff-title">Managing Partner/Co-Founder</h3></center>
												<p>Golf has been at the center of Mike's life since he was a boy growing up in a Milwaukee suburb. Mike began as a caddie at the local club, and later worked on its grounds crew and in the pro shop, before becoming an assistant pro at a Cleveland-area club. Wanting to pursue his love of the game as a career, Mike earned his degree in Golf Course Turfgrass Management from Penn State, the preeminent school in the field. Mike interned at Augusta National, and later served as Golf Course Superintendent at Long Cove Club, a Pete Dye masterpiece on Hilton Head Island. Although Mike left the industry for a more stable career as a principal in a national dental dealer corporation, his love for the game endured. Mike launched Three Oaks Golf for him to pursue a new and exciting role in the world of golf.</p>
